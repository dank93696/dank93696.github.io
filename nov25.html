<p> I got a chemistry unit test on tuesday that I should really be studying for, but I'm sick rn and really dont feel like doing anything that requires brain power :/ 
    its gonna bite me in the ass so hard because i seriously know nothing from this unit, and theres like 2 booklets of stuff i gotta know! This time around i really got no one but myself to blame
    I couldve studied but i chose not to, I SWEAR ITS NOT MY FAULT THAT I DONT KNOW THE MATERIAL THE CLASS IS JUST SOOOOOO BORING I CANT STAND IT!!!

<p>I finished the new scott pilgrim show on netflix last night and hoooolllly shit it was so good. im gonna be honest I havent seen the scoot pilgrim movie before or watched or read any of the other scott pilgrim material and 
    so this was my first time checking out the franchise, and after watching this i might just go and check out the rest of the stuff. But seriously this show slapped. Like I went in with some pretty low expectations because I was expecting it to be filled with this cringy, over the top dialouge 
    and other misconceptions just because I knew that scott pilgrim as a framchise is very big on nerd-y sort of stuff but to be honest it was not like that at all. In fact all that stuff actually fit so seemlessly with the style and attitude of the show 
    so when it was really embracing its nerdiness it was super natural and incredibly entertaining. I'm also so happy the voice acting was as good as it was because thats my problem with watching animated stuff, outside of like dreamworks, is that the voices are typically these unatural and annoying
    performances that to me just are such a slog to sit through. but every single voice actor here does a fantastic job, they just sound like normal human beings. But what i love most about this show is easily the STYLE. its AMAZING and super entertaining to watch. Thank god we finally have something good to represent the 6 (no i havent been to TIFF)
    and THANK GOD netflix is finally making their subscription (somewhat) worth having.

<h2><font color=purple>Love</font></h2>
<div/>
<p>i think i fell in love, which is very rare for me, i've had a handful of crushes but i have never been in LOVE yk? the person in question is my best friend. Its so cliche i know that but its the truth.
    I really hope he or any of my other friends never stumble across this page as it will be VERY OBVIOUS its me. the whole situation breaks my heart. to start with he might not like men (no one knows i do) HOWEVER ive been noticing little signs which HINT THAT HE MIGHT BE. secondly how could I even tell him such a thing?
and at the end of the day, how could we even love each other? it wont work. if we end up breaking up it will ruin our friendship. but what i feel for him is strong. i've never felt this way about another person.  </p>
