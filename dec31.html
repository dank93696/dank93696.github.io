<h1>dec31 - possibly the saddest day of my entire life</h1>


<div/>
<p> i spent my new years eve alone. my friends were all doing things with other people, same with my family. all i did was sit in front of the tv waiting for time to pass, people would text me asking what i had planned and i had to shamefully tell them i had no one to spend time with. 
    the whole time i rotted at home i felt a overwhelming sense of emptiness.

<h2>i want to dissapear</h2>
<div/>
<p>i've never been suicidal because i could never face death willingly. death feels so absolute to me, you can not return from it and likley nothing is waiting on the other side. for a long time i jsut wanted to abandon my life, in the ultimate act of cowardice, and just dissapear. take some clothes, hop on a train, cut all contact with everyone i know, and go far away. 
    i want to never talk to another human being ever again and rot in some alleyway taking all the drugs i can get my hands on, i want to see if anyone really even cared at all if i ended up dissapearing one day. this urge has been growing so much stronger recently that im just about ready to pass that point of no return.

<div class="container"><h3> im not good at writing these posts out. i never find what i actually want to say. my shame in myself always prevents me from putting my true self out to the world. </h3>
</div>
<h3>i dont know if ive ever truly seen eye to eye with another human being. sometimes i wonder if i have a problem or that i just simply cant understand other people.</h3>
</div>
<h3>i love life, but i dont know if i love my life right now. i live so that i can find life's beauty and expirience it, thats why i will never die by my own accord.</h3>
