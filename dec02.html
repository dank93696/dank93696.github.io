<h1>dec02 - lack of entries and funky looking images</h1>


<div/>
<p> I'm not going to update this website regularly by a set schedule or anything like that, i'm just gonna do it when i feel like it. I tried to figure out how to have an image on one side 
    of the page and the text on the other, i figured it out but then i still wanted a text box on top of it. in the end the silly looking "most listened to song" section was born. lowkey i think it looks kinda cool like that at the bottom
    so im just gonna leave it be.

<p>Today me and my friends spent 8 hours just driving around, just going to peoples houses and having fun. Towards the end of the night we went to one of my friends houses because he has a movie theatre room and we wanted to watch something.
    We were just scrolling through netflix trying to find something to watch when we decided on end of evanglion. 3 out of the 4 of us already seen it and just felt like putting it on. The one who hasnt seen it obviously thought it was weird as shit,
    rightfully so because there is undeniably weird shit in the movie that doesnt need to be there. This movie holds a special place in my heart despite those flaws because it left such an impression on me when i first watched it like 2 years ago. Evangelion in general couldnt have 
    come to me in a more perfect time in my life. I was feeling alienated despite having plenty friends and once i was finished with the series i couldnt stop thinking about it. No other movie or show has ever left an impression on me like that, that just made me feel so empty after watching it.
    so obviously i could overlook its weird shit. So when we were watching the movie i was saying how i love it so much, without telling them that corny stuff i was talking about earlier because they dont have to know that, and they just make me feel so shitty for liking stuff like this. end of eva in
    particular i have an emotional connection to and they just kept jokingly saying i was a pedo because the movie shows so much tits and stuff. obviosuly its a joke but that shit isnt even funny like they just call me a fukin pedophile for liking a movie that helped me during a rough time. 
    This applies to so much of the movies and stuff i like, like its not my fault some fucked up director wanted to put a couple of stupid fucked up scenes in their movies that i just so happen to love. it makes me look like a fucking creep to my friends and i can never talk to them about the stuff i like.
    Its not even that i like this fucked of stuff in my movies, in fact i hate it when a movie i was loving so far adds a rape scene, or sexualized children, or weird fetish trash that just shouldnt be there. it just makes it SO MUCH HARDER to recommend to people and talk with my friends. Like i straight up CANT unless its anime 
    but even then i gotta be careful when saying a show.

<p>i watched it, it was pretty good. not like super mind-blowing or anything but it didnt need to be. This section honeslty ties in with the first one a tiny bit but not really, because ive seen people criticise the age gap between the 2 main characters
    and to be completly honest i didnt have a problem with it. like first and foremost my PARENTS have the same age gap depicted in the movie (AND THEY MET WHEN MY MOM WAS 17 XD) so i didnt think it was very odd to begin with besides when they were having sex in the movie it was a bit off-putting, mainly due to the questionable acting decision for Oliver.
    He looks like hes 45 in the movie when hes only supposed to be like 24. that decision alone is probably what caused the film to be frowned apon because it does kinda look like a 40 year old man fucking a child. my arguement kinda sounds like that shit discord mods would say about lolis and how its actually not a child and a 4000 year old demon lady instead.
