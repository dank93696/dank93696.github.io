<h1>dec21 - homepage</h1>


<div/>
<p> I want to work on making the homepage look better on this site. I'm gonna try to add some images or something on the right side, and i also want to make it so you can read a sample from the most recent 
    log, like whatever i write in this black section would be on display, im gonna give it a shot but i hate trying to segment stuff like with float and stuff it doesnt work for me it always messes up. I'm too lazy to try that right now and its
    too early also so ill do it another time.

<h2><font color = red>season of </font> <font color = green>giving</font></h2>

<div/>
<p>I mentioned how im feeling especially jolly this year, and i really wanted to contribute to the 'giving' part of the christmas presents expirience because in the past i only ever really got one for my sister. The only problem is that its SO HARD to shop 
    for my parents its like i hardly even know what they like, well i know what they like its just hard to shop for. and i also just simply dont have enough money to be affording gifts fdor everyone. It makes me feel so guilty for not getting them anything 
    but my mom keeps insisting to not get them stuff :( also over the years the idea of gifts for christmas just seems more and more unnecessary for me. I hate it when i recieve gifts because it makes me so upset that people spent money on me that they didnt have to.
    It probably sounds stupid i know but i just dont want to be a burden to anyone and having people give me gifts makes me feel like one. When i look at my sister and see her asking for tons of different expensive items and having such an stupidly long list makes me wonder if she 
    even feels any shame at all. I'm not going to pretend like im not materialistic of course i am but i try to be materialistic only with stuff that i purchase for myself, because to me those feel like achievements and that i earned them with the work i put in to afford them. When i recieve a gift
    obviously i am appreciative and thankful, but at the same time i feel a bit of sadness that they had to buy it for me.

<p>enjoy the silence - depeche mode. my parents have been playing this song my entire life, at like family parties and stuff, and i didnt pay it much attention back then. i knew it was a pretty good song but just didnt care back then. I never knew the name of it until last week when i rediscovered it.
    and then it all came to me in an instant it felt like. this song fucking SLAPS. its a perfect song in my opinion but i guess i do also give it nostalgia bonus points. I've been pretty much playing this song on repeat for the past few days and im also listening to it right now on repeat as i write this. ALL I EVER WANTED, 
    ALL I EVER NEEDED, IS HEEERRRRREEEEEEEEEE, IN MY ARMSSSSSSSSSSSSS. WORDS ARE VERY UNNECESSARY, THEYYYYYYY CANNNNNN ONLLLLLYYYYYY DOOOOO HAAAAAAARRRRRMMMMMMMMMMMMM

<h2><font color="purple">hes about to get a girlfriend :/</font></h2>
<div/>
<p>Ok well they are not officially dating yet, they are still friends by definition, but they are spending alot of time together. he tells us about how he hangs out with her and plays games with her and stuff. Its clear he likes her and she also confirms she likes him back.
    theres alot of problems with this but the biggest is that shes not a great person. Shes the biggest fiend ever and everyone knows it, shes a walking red flag and everyone has warned him but hes desperate decided to go for it. I was pretty devastated when I heard she liked him back and I'm also kind of jealous to be completely honest.
