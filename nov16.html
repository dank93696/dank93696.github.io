    <h1>nov16 - I created a website</h1>
    <div> </div>
    <p>    For the past couple days I've had this urge to create a website
         just because I felt like putting my thoughts out there. Obviously I don't expect anyone to read this 
         and thats great because this will essentially act as journal or diary or something like that.

<h2> <font color="red">  Mysterious Skins....     </font>  </h2>
<div/>
  <p>I watched this movie last night, Mysterious Skins, and I am very conflicted about it. From a film standpoint I cant say I was particularly impressed with much,
    the acting was very solid and the film itself was engaging from beginning to end. So that stuff alone should make it a very decent movie right? my problem starts with the 
    actual main plotline of this movie, <font color="red"> *spoilers* </font> so basically its about pedophilia and how this guy convinced himself he was kidnapped by aliens to cope with the trauma,
    and alot of the details are left somewhat vague until the plot twist at the end when it all makes sense. The plot twist is cool im ngl, but I dont like the portrayal of pedophilia in this movie.
     It seems almost romanticised in a way for a large portion of the movie. I'm very much a minority and I may just be overreacting here because everyone seems to love this film, it has majority 4.5 to 5 stars on letterboxd.
     The thing is with movies like this if they arent being exploitive of their fucked up subject matter then its supposedly sending some kind of message, which I cant seem to find fuck all of for the life of me. 
     Like, everyone knows pedophilia is bad! this isnt some new revolutionary thing being said about the topic.
     Even ignoring the pedophile stuff, theres a bunch of other stuff that ticks me off as well, like how the whole aliens idea really isnt fleshed out that well, that opening scene where the guy and his family LITERALLY SAW A UFO IN THE FUCKING SKY is never brought up or mentioned again, as well as other details like how tf he ended up in the 
    basement cellar after the innapropriate stuff was done if he was unconsious, but I'm done rambling about this movie for now.

    <h2>
      <font color="blue"> Platinum Trophy</font>
    </h2>
    <div></div>
    <p> I got a ps5 recently and have been just casually playing through spiderman 2 which was included with the console. I've never owned a playstation or a console like that before
      (besides an old nintendo switch with joycon drift I guess) and didnt know alot of what to expect. I knew of the whole trophy system before and people made it out to be the hardest
      thing ever to get a platinum trophy in a game. It was honestly really easy to get the platinum in Spiderman 2 I managed to 100% the game in only 32 hours or so, and i was playing at a pretty 
      slow pace. Not to say it was a bad game or anything like that it was amazing and super fun I should honestly make a whole section just talking about it but I was pretty underwhelmed that I could finish it
      so quickly. I'm sure it depends on the game. Besides that the ps5 is so awesome so far I got ps plus so im playing uno and shit with my friends, the graphics absolutly clobber my pc and spiderman 2 looked 
      stunning. Also want to add that this was possibly the biggest purchase i've ever made it was like $800 at the end for the whole bundle and holy shit did I cry a little when I saw that total. 
      Thank christ I had like $3000 saved up from working at mcdonalds for a couple months. I seriously might have to go back to work there tho my wallets looking kinda thin these days.
