    <h1>nov16 - I created a website</h1>
    <div> </div>
    <p>    For the past couple days I've had this urge to create a website
         just because I felt like putting my thoughts out there. Obviously I don't expect anyone to read this 
         and thats great because this will essentially act as journal or diary or something like that.

  <p>I watched this movie last night, Mysterious Skins, and I am very conflicted about it. From a film standpoint I cant say I was particularly impressed with much,
    the acting was very solid and the film itself was engaging from beginning to end. So that stuff alone should make it a very decent movie right? my problem starts with the 
    actual main plotline of this movie, <font color="red"> *spoilers* </font> so basically its about pedophilia and how this guy convinced himself he was kidnapped by aliens to cope with the trauma,
    and alot of the details are left somewhat vague until the plot twist at the end when it all makes sense. The plot twist is cool im ngl, but I dont like the portrayal of pedophilia in this movie.
     It seems almost romanticised in a way for a large portion of the movie. I'm very much a minority and I may just be overreacting here because everyone seems to love this film, it has majority 4.5 to 5 stars on letterboxd.
     The thing is with movies like this if they arent being exploitive of their fucked up subject matter then its supposedly sending somekind of message, which I cant seem to find fuck all of for the life of me. 
     Like, everyone knows pedophilia is bad! this isnt some new revolutionary thing being said about the topic. it kinda reminds me of how suicide is treated in 13 Reasons Why, which is an absolute fucking dumpster fire
    of a show. Even ignoring the pedophile stuff, theres a bunch of other stuff that ticks me off as well, like how the whole aliens idea really isnt fleshed out that well, that opening scene where the guy and his family LITERALLY SAW A UFO IN THE FUCKING SKY is never brought up or mentioned again, as well as other details like how tf he ended up in the 
    basement cellar after the innapropriate stuff was done if he was unconsious, but I'm done rambling about this movie for now.
