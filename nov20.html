     <h1>nov20 - I'm learning  </h1>
     <div></div>
     <p> This is essentially my first time coding anything (if html even counts) and so I'm basically getting everything from youtube tutorials
        and quora responses. Theres a lot more stuff I want to do with this website but for now i'm still learning. Give me some time and this will be a masterpiece. But to be 100%
        honest even if I could make the website look better i probably wouldnt because I love the way early internet websites looked, and i guess ill just try to emulate that because to me 
        those websites just look so warm and nostalgic, even if I wasnt alive to expirence them XD.

<h2> <font color="red">Being informed </font></h2>
<div/>
<p> I feel like people are often times too quick to jump on a bandwagon before educating themselves on a situation. I saw a tiktok a while back that essentially proves that. The video in question
    was about people taking a stance on the hamas and isreal war currently going on. It was one of those joke slideshows where it shows people having different opinions and then someone having a "correct"
    opinion (its kinda hard to describe lmao) the video is clearly a joke but when I read the comments it left a bad taste in my mouth. Basically it was a bunch of people saying how they only support palestine because its the popular thing to do.
    Now, I don't have an opinion on the conflict. I can at least recognize that I am not informed enough to just immediately support one side. Which is what I expect most people would do but apparently not! Apparently it makes more sense to come to a super rash conclusion 
    after not researching at all! At the end of the day it really shouldnt bother me and I dont even know why im talking about it. I dont like politics. But it just made me mad to see people make opinions on serious topics so rash-ly (is rash-ly a word?)

<h2> <font color="brown">Stress </font> </h2>
<div/>
<p>  
It seems like I constantly have something to stress over no matter what. Its like as soon as something starts to get better my brain finds something else to make me lose sleep over. Whether it be school or my self esteem its like there is something 
constantly chewing at my psyche. And the big thing this school year for me to be loseing my shit over are my grades. To be fair I was never really that smart, not dumb either but holy shit something changed this year. My grades went DOWN SO FUCKING BADLY 
and it really sucks because grade 11 is the year where this shit starts to actually matter, and i actually wanna go to university too T_T . On the brightside that was at the beginning of the semester and i've been dedicated to raising my marks. I took away my own computer and all my shit, I put sceen time limits on my phone, and for like a month and a half 
I WAS LOCKED TF IN and now my grade are actually alot better. I took off all the restrictions and shit because me and my friend bought our ps5's and you got me fucked up if you think I'm just gonna let it sit there and marinate for another month. However because of this my recent quiz scores have been getting progressivley shittier so now i'm bout to lock in again 
and focus on that grind once again.
