<h1>dec17 - happy holidays!!!!!</h1>


<div/>
<p> i forgot to write anything for a while, life is going alright. Christmas is just around the corner and i have yet to purchase any presents for my family, this year i really wanted to 
    be involved and buy all my family members presents so thats what im going to do. Im feeling extra jolly this year, i typically dont get overlly festive but something is different this year i just cant explain it.
    to get into the spirit i listened to "santa" by the goat of rap Lil B, its a 5 hour long album that has absolutely nothing to do with christmas besides the amazing album art. obviously i couldnt do it in a single sitting it took me a couple art and accounting classes to get through
    but to be honest i really liked the album. it had majority really solid songs on it, except that instrumental section that was straight up painful to sit through, and the song "thank god im based" is really a top 5 lil b track.

<div/>
<p>i wanted to watch it for the longest time and finally got around to it today and finished it like less than half an hour ago. it was good i loved the first two hours of it but the last hour was hard to get through. it was really confusing to me lol. like after i finished the movie i got it all and it made sense 
    but for the longest time during that last hour it was a drag. i was a little pissed off not by the movie itself but the struggle i went through to actually WATCH it. my family recently set up a projector 'movie' room in our basement and i really wanted to watch the movie there with them
    so i was trying to pirate it because you got me fucked up if you think im paying that outrageous $25 purchase cost. the 4k download took 30 minutes and then for some stupid fucking reason it wouldnt let me move the file to my usb drive which i would then plug into the projector, i searched it up and it said i had to reformat the usb.
    the problem is that this usb has other movies on it so i had to back them up onto my hard drive so i can reformat the fucking thing which took SO FUCKING LONG to move to my drive, and then had to FINALLY move oppenheimer to the usb WHICH TOOK FUCKING FOREVER i stg it was like another hour of waiting. after that i plugged the usb
    into the projector with the impression it would let me play the media on it becuase "usb" was a selectible source, BUT APPARENTLY NOT so i had to get a laptop to plug it into WHICH WAS SO SHITTY IT CAUSED THE FRAMERATE OF THE MOVIE TO BE LOWER THAN NORMAL AND WAS SO JARRING. ok it wasnt THAT bad i guess but it was pretty annoying to watch. solid movie tho.

<h2><font color="light blue">why is liturgy so hated?</font></h2>
<div/>
<p>i'm not a metalhead or anything of the sort. i LIKE the genre, but i seriously have not listened to NEARLY enough albums for me to say i'm a metal fan. from what i have heard tho, i really love liturgy. if you havent already noticed my username and the name of this website is based off liturgy's latest release, 93696.
    the music, to me at least, seems just really well done so it makes me very confused when i go online and see so many people hating them so much. i get if its just preference which is fine but when some people talk about them they really HATE them and it just makes me so confused why.
